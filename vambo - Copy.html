	<p class="ps">And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
enlightened or unenlightened : -- "Behold ! , human beings living in a
underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and
reaching all along the den. Here they have been from their childhood,
and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and
can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning
round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance,
and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you
will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
puppets."
"I see".
